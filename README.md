# RYO Forms: AI-Powered Form Creation and Data Analysis

RYO (Roll Your Own) Forms is an innovative tool meant to change the development process of creating forms and data analysis. Built as a result of a hackathon, RYO Forms uses the powers of generative artificial intelligence in easier-to-complete form creation processes while simultaneously offering other sophisticated data analysis features. It supports both technical and non-technical users because making forms is intuitive and very accessible.

## Features

### AI-Powered Form Creation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can generate complete, functional forms by inputting natural language prompts. The AI interprets these prompts and constructs forms that align with user requirements.
  
- **Intuitive User Interface**: The platform boasts a user-friendly interface designed for rapid form design. Drag-and-drop functionality allows users to easily arrange form fields and modify layout elements without any coding expertise.
  
- **Diverse Field Types**: RYO Forms supports various field types to cater to a wide range of data collection needs, including:
  - **Short Answer**: For brief responses or single-line text input.
  - **Long Answer**: For detailed text inputs requiring more extensive responses.
  - **Email**: To validate and collect email addresses.
  - **Number**: For numerical data inputs, ensuring correct formatting.
  - **Multiple Choice**: Users can select a single option from a predefined list.
  - **Multi-Select**: For selecting multiple options, enhancing user flexibility.
  - **Date Input**: For choosing a specific date from a calendar view.
  
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement conditional logic to create dynamic forms that adapt based on user responses. This feature enables the display of relevant fields based on previous answers, making forms more interactive and efficient.

### Intelligent Data Analysis
- **Natural Language Queries**: Users can interact with their data through natural language queries, allowing them to extract insights and perform analyses without needing complex SQL or coding skills.
  
- **Advanced Filtering and Searching**: RYO Forms provides robust filtering and searching capabilities, allowing users to segment and analyze data according to various criteria. This feature enhances data visibility and aids in decision-making.
  
- **Data Export**: Users can easily export collected data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, etc.), facilitating integration with other data analysis tools or systems for further insights.
  
- **AI-Generated Documents**: Based on form responses, RYO Forms can generate comprehensive documents automatically. This includes reports, summaries, or any other necessary documentation, saving users significant time and effort.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Developed using **React** with **Next.js** to enable server-side rendering and efficient routing, providing a fast and responsive user experience.
  
- **Programming Language**: Utilizes **TypeScript** to ensure type-safe code, improving code quality and reducing runtime errors through static type checking.
  
- **Styling**: Built with **Tailwind CSS**, allowing for rapid UI development with utility-first styling, enabling a customizable and aesthetically pleasing design.
  
- **AI Integration**: Incorporates the **OpenAI API** for natural language processing and generation, facilitating advanced interactions and enabling the AI to understand user queries effectively.
